# Football-Project
## Overview 
This is a python project that includes basic machine learning and website scrapping using python library (beautiful soup). This is my very first project using beautiful soup.

## Brief 
- Using the library beautiful soup to do website scrapping
- Using scikit-learn to work on the machine learning process

## Timeframe and Technology
### Timeframe: 3 days

### Technology/ Libraries/ Framework
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter notebook

## Models 

- SGD Classifier 
- Random Forest 

## Approach Taken 
- In this project, I wanted a data where it contain players played for every match and combining the fifa player stats. Here, the chanllenge I faced is the website to scrape as some website the information is not consistent.
- After choosing a consistent website, I take some time to understading the format of the HTML or XML of the website and beginh writing the web scrapping script. This allow me to contruct the dataframe I needed.
- Then I split my data into two set, traning set and test set. Plugin the training set and test set to the model I chose previously.
### Accuracy 
- SGD Classifier -> 
0.42897435897435904
- Random Forest -> 
0.5352564102564102

## Wins
- In this project, I'm able to grasp the knowledge of website scrapping and the fundamentals of HTML and XML. This allow me to get data that cathered to the needs for my project.
- Learning the basics of machine learning and learning the fundamentals of it. Mainly learning how it works behind the scene.

## Challenge 
- The main challenge I faced in this project is understading how the XML and HTML structured. I overcome this hurdles by making use of chrome dev tools to identify the location or syntax of the needed player name or data.

## Learning Process
- What I learnt from this project is using the library of beautiful soup to scrape data and using pandas to manipulate the data I need for the machine learning process.
- Able to have basic understamding of machine learning process.

## Future Features/ What I will work on furthur
- More machine learning technique as for now is just linear modeling. 
- Building pipeline for data scraping and data cleaning.
